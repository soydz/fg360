# Fleet Guard 360

## API Gateway

This project is the API Gateway for the microservices architecture. 
It serves as the main entry point for frontend clients, handling request routing,
JWT authentication, CORS, and communication with backend services.

The gateway centralizes security, simplifies the frontend’s access to multiple microservices,
and ensures a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

The application runs on port **8085** by default.
